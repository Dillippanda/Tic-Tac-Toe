# Tic-Tac-Toe
This Tic-Tac-Toe game code is designed for beginners, providing a straightforward implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure consists of a 3x3 grid representing the game board, styled with basic CSS to give it a neat appearance. Each cell of the grid is clickable, allowing players to make their moves by placing X or O symbols alternately. The JavaScript code handles the game logic, checking for win conditions, and updating the board accordingly. It utilizes event listeners to detect player clicks and dynamically update the grid with the chosen symbol. The code is well-commented and structured to be easy to understand for those new to web development, making it a great starting point for learning about frontend development and game programming.
